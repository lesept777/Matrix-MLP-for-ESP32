# Classify data above or below a sine curve
This example shows how to classify 2D data compared to a sine curve.

First a dataset is created with random input data chosen in the [0,1]x[0,1] square, and output set to 0 if the point is under the sine curve and 1 if above.

## Training
Training parameters are set and the optimization is run. Results are given in the file [Output.txt](./Output.txt).
